    description="Allies won't target you when you're polymorphed. Probably.
    I almost never use allies since they're going to try their hardest to kill me if I get polymorphed... This mod fixes that! But beware, you are still vulnerable to friendly-fire! It works by applying a temporary invisible pheromone effect to the player whenever they're polymorphed, so it should work with all modded allies and poly effects.

    Untested in multiplayer, but it should probably work."
