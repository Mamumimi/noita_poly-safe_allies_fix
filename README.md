# Poly-Safe Allies Fix

Allies won't target you when you're polymorphed now.

I almost never use allies since they're going to try their hardest to kill me if I get polymorphed... This mod fixes that! It works by applying a temporary invisible pheromone effect to the player whenever they're polymorphed. This does not prevent damage, it just makes it so they won't attack you on purpose.

Untested in multiplayer, but I've done my best to make it compatible.
